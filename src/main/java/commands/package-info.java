 *     This package provides the different commands that are available for the user.
 *     For example: {@link commands.GenerateCommand} GenerateCommand is a command that will trigger
 *     the generation of specific resource

 *     Use {@link commands.GenerateCommand} GenerateCommand to generate different resources like APIRest and GraphQL
 *     resources.

 * <p>
 *     Unlike {@link commands.GenerateCommand} GenerateCommand , the {@link commands.DeleteCommand} DeleteCommand is used
